My first app written with Motoko as part of my journey to learn how to code on the blockchain.

This app is very simple, with the ability to update your balance based on if you want to deposit money or withdraw money. 

The app also has a whopping 1% per second compound interest rate on the balance, which will update on refresh.

**As this was done as part of a bootcamp, the Motoko code was written by following along with my tutor. However, the vast majority of the Javascript was written by me (there were a few palces where I needed help to integrate the Motoko with the Javascript.**
